### Properties of XOR<br>

1. Commutative: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
2. Associative: A ⊕ ( B ⊕ C ) = ( A ⊕ B ) ⊕ C
3. Identity element: A ⊕ 0 = A
4. Self-inverse: A ⊕ A = 0
5. Parity: for any n bits, A1 ⊕ A2 ⊕ … ⊕ An = 1 (iff the # of 1s is odd)
<br>

### Uses of XOR <br>

1. Toggling<br>

~~~cpp
//toggles between two values x and y
for (int n=x; true; n^=(x^y))
  cout<<n;
~~~

2. Swapping without temproary variable <br>
~~~cpp
void s(int& a, int& b){
  a = a^b;
  b = a^b;
  a = a^b;
}
~~~

3. Assembly Language<br>
XOR'ing a register with itself is the fastest way for the compiler to zero the register

4. Doubly Linked List<br>
we can store XOR'd value of the previous and next pointers<br>

5. Encryption<br>

6. Error Detection<br>
XOR all bits to get a single parity bit and append it to the end of the message. If the received parity bit is different from
the calculated one, a single bit has been corrupted. However, this cannot detect if two bits are corrupted.

7. RAID data protection<br>
Create an additional hard drive which contains the XOR value of all other n drives.<br>
If a failure occurs on one drive, we can restore it from the others. (If 2 drives fail simultaneously, it does not work)
