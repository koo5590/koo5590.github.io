#### There are 4 differents ways to iterate through an array.<br>

<b>FIRST</b>
~~~cpp
// C style
for(int i=0; i<list.size(); i++)
  list[i] = 0;
~~~

<b>SECOND</b>
~~~cpp
//copies each elemenet in the list to x
for(auto x:list)
  x = 0;
~~~

<b>THIRD</b>
~~~cpp
//using reference declaration, 
//which makes x an alias for each element in the list
//if x is built-in type(int, bool, etc) it doesn't make a big difference in time efficiency
for(auto &x:list)
  x = 0;
~~~

<b>FOURTH</b>
~~~cpp
//x is declared as const
//x is only readable
for(const auto &x: list)
  cout << x;
~~~


Second, third, and fourth loops are called "range-based" for loops (using auto specifiers).<br>
If we iteratre through an object for which begin() and end() memeber functions are defined,
below is also possible
~~~cpp
for(auto it=list.begin(); it!=list.end(); ++it)
  cout << *it;
~~~
This is useful when used with containers like map or set.
